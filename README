 disktype 3
============

The purpose of disktype is to detect the content format of a disk or
disk image. It knows about common file systems, partition tables, and
boot codes.

The program is written in C and is designed to compile on any modern
Unix flavour. It requires no special libraries, except on Mac OS X,
where it uses the CoreServices framework to get the Mac OS type and
creator code of a file.


 Installation
--------------

GNU make is required to build disktype. The Makefile is set up to use
GCC, but can be edited if required. Alternatively, the standard
variables CC, CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS can be changed from
the make command line.

Running make results in the binary 'disktype'. Copy it to a 'bin'
directory of your choice, optionally stripping it on the way. That's
all.


 Usage
-------

The 'disktype' program can be run with any number of regular files or
block devices as arguments. They will be analyzed in the order
given, and the results printed to standard output. There are no
switches in this version. Note that running disktype on block devices
like your hard disk will likely require root rights.


 Recognized Formats
--------------------

The following formats are recognized by this version of disktype.

File systems: FAT12/FAT16/FAT32, ext2/ext3, Minix, MFS, HFS, HFS Plus,
  ISO9660, ReiserFS, NTFS, HPFS, Linux romfs, Linux cramfs, UFS (some
  variations), JFS.

Partition maps: DOS/PC style, Apple.

Boot codes: LILO, GRUB, SYSLINUX, ISOLINUX, Linux kernel.

Archive formats: gzip, compress, bzip2, tar, cpio, bar, dump/restore.

Other structures: Debian split floppy header, Linux swap, Linux RAID
  physical disks, Linux LVM physical volumes.

Compressed files (gzip, compress, bzip2 formats) will also have their
contents analyzed using transparent decompression. The appropriate
compression program must be installed on the system, i.e. 'gzip' for
the gzip and compress formats, 'bzip2' for the bzip2 format.

Raw-mode CD images (e.g. the .bin file of a .bin/.cue pair) are
recognized and translated transparently. Since version 3 this actually
looks at the data instead of guessing based on file size. It still
doesn't know about multiple tracks or sessions, but seems to be
sufficient even for (S)VCD disks.


 Future Plans
--------------

To fulfill its purpose, disktype needs to know about as much formats
as possible. If you know a file system not yet included and can
provide me with (pointers to) format information, please contact me at
<chrisp@users.sourceforge.net>. I'm also looking for information on
disk image formats (e.g. used by backup apps or CD mastering
software).
